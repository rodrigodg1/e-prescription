if you are using a testnet other than [cliffnet](https://github.com/CosmWasm/testnets), you will need to update the network parameters in the client file: `client-cosmwasm.sh`

To send transactions, use the same script:

    ./client-cosmwasm.sh
or

    ./auto.sh

You can remove all evaluation data using:

    ./reset_evaluation.sh
